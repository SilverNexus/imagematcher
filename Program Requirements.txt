Use OpenCV to:
Find duplicate images.
Indicate which one has the highest resolution (optional).

It should take the images, compare them, list what matches ( no duplicates in list like x is y ...  y is x) then clicking on the match, files are listed, then clicking on files, file attributes, properties are listed.

Raw matches (according to Troy) only, no need to adjust for aspect ratio. We'll see if that actually works or not.

Efficiency is a minor concern.

Will have 16x16, 32x32, and 64x64 icon set. Troy said he'd produce those.


Comparison of images is likely O(n^2). All images need to be compared against all other images.

Images are defined as files with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png extensions.
